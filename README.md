# SCC-File-Renamer
SCC File Renamer is a script that will flip the order of 2 strings within the filenames of a batch of files, so long as the filenames are of the following syntax: 

String1 #### String2 - Suffixes

I use this script at work on a weekly basis, for the purpose of keeping a sorting timesheets in order by either client/project or employee. Below is an example of an application of this filename syntax that is typically used in my current workplace, as well as how the filename would be converted.

ProjectA MMDD EmployeeD - Notes yada yada
->
EmployeeD MMDD ProjectA - Notes yada yada

This is very useful for renaming a large number of such files at once.
